  ### Crafting Customer-Centric Solutions
  
  With a PhD in Systems Biology and experience across Data Science and Analytics, I bring a unique, 
  interdisciplinary perspective to solving product and customer problems. 
  From my early work building predictive and NLP models at OLX to my current role at N26, 
  I’ve consistently focused on extracting meaningful insights and building solutions that 
  elevate user experience and guide strategic decisions.

  What drives me is the blend of analytical depth and real-world impact: designing 
  thoughtful analyses, building reliable data models, and uncovering the “why” behind 
  complex systems. I enjoy collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, 
  translating technical rigor into clear narratives that support confident decisions.

  Across all my work, I strive to bring clarity, structure, and empathy, ensuring that data 
  not only informs but truly empowers teams to build better experiences for the people they serve.

  ## My journey

  Discovering the world of data during my PhD was a turning point. The countless hours spent analysing transcriptomics datasets 
  and collaborating with Data Scientists opened my eyes to the real-world impact of data-driven work.  
  That experience set me on the path toward Data Science and Analytics,
  where I strive to achieve the perfect balance between analytical depth, problem-solving, and meaningful impact.
